## Abstract
Our objective is to develop a percussive game in the style of Guitar Hero or Rock Band.
Whereas these games employ the use of plastic instruments with buttons or piezoelectric transducers
we plan on taking the input from a microphone, extract audio features from the sampled audio signal, 
and determine whether a player successfully reproduced the requested body movement (clap, slap, or snap)
from the display on the screen.

## Components
* Audio Extraction
* Screen Display
* Song Sequencer
